## Reading 1: Ethics and Trust in the Investment Profession

1. Ethical behavior is that which conforms to a set of rules and moral principles based on shared beliefs about what behavior is acceptable and what behavior is unacceptable.
2. a professional code of ethics is a way for a profession to communicate to the public that its members will use their knowledge and skills to serve their clients in an honest and ethical way, and can increase public confidence and trust that members will act ethically.
3. challenges to ethical behavior include overestimating one's own ethical character, considering only near-term consequences and not longer-term consequences of behavior, and letting situational influences, such as peer pressure, unduly affect one's decisions and behavior.
4. Investment professionals have a special responsibility to use their specialized in knowledge and skills to both protect and grow kind. The fact that investment management is an intangible products makes high ethical standards all the more important in the financial services profession. 
5. not all unethical actions are illegal. and not all illegal actions are unethical. laws are more specific than ethical principles and often address prior unethical behavior. ethical behavior requires more judgment, acts such as civil disobedience may considered ethical even when they are illegal.
6. a framework for ethical decision making is designed to lead to better decisions by identifying the stakeholders affected and the conflicts of interest among them, considering alternative actions and the relevant situational influences on decision makers, seeking out different perspectives and evaluating decisions to see if they had unintended consequences.

# Session 6

## Reading 21: Financial Statement Analysis: Introduction



1. roles of financial reporting and financial statement analysis.
2. balance sheet, statement of financial position or condition: assets = liabilities + owners' equity
3. income statement, statement of operations or the profit and loss statement: revenues, expenses, and other income [ gains and loss ]
4. statement of changes in equity
5. statement of cash flows: operation cfo, investing cfi, financing cff
6. fianancial statement notes, also footnotes
7. management's commentary, also management discussion & analysis
8. audit: unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion;
9. financial statement analysis framework: objective and context -> data -> process data -> analyze and interpret data -> conclusions -> update the analysis



## Reading 22: Financial Reporting Mechanics



1. accounting equation
   1. assets = liabilities + owners' equity
   2. assets = liabilities + (contributed capital + ending retained earnings)
   3. assets = liabilities + (contributed capital + beginning retained earnings + revenue - expenses - dividends)
2. double entry accounting: a transaction has to be recorded in at least 2 accounts
3. accrual accounting: requires that revenue is recorded when the firm earns it and expenses are recorded as the firm incurs thems, regardness of whether or not the cash has been paid. falls into 4 categories as following:
   1. unearned revenue: 预收收入，公司在向客户提供服务或商品前收到现金，现金增加，负债同时也增加。当公司提供商品或服务的时候，收入增加，负债减少；
   2. accrued revenue：应记收入，公司在收到现金前提供商品或服务，收入增加，应收账款增加，当客户支付了现金，应收账款减少；
   3. prepaid expenses：预付费用，公司提前支付确定金额的费用，现金【一项资产】减少，预付费用【一项资产】增加，当费用实际发生的时候，预付费用减少而费用增加。
   4. accrued expenses：应记费用，公司拖欠的已经发生的费用，费用增加，作为一项负债的应记费用也增加；当公司支付了之后，负债才会减少。



## Reading 23: Financial Reporting Standards



1. Standard-setting bodies -> Regulatory authorities
   1. FASB US: Financial Accounting Standards Board -> GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
   2. IASB: International Accounting Standards Board -> IFRS: International Financial Reporting Standards
2. IASB:
   1. objective: provide financial information that is useful in making decisions about providing resources to an entity;
   2. qualititative characteristics: relevance and faithful representation; comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability;
3. measurement base: 
   1. historical cost:the amount originally paid for the assets
   2. amortized cost: historical cost adjusted for depreciation, amortization, depletion and impairment
   3. current cost: the amount the firm would have to pay today for the same asset
   4. realizable value: the amount for which the firm could sell the asset 
   5. present value: the discounted value of the assets expected future cash flows 
   6. fair value: the amount at which two parties in an arm's-length transaction would exchange the asset.
4. asuumptions about financial statements: accrual accounting, going concern;
5. constraints: cost-benefit, non-quantifiable.
6. IOSCO: protect investors, ensure the fairness, efficiency and transparency of markets, ***reduce*** systemic risk.
7. qualitative characteristics: relevance and faithful representation; comparability, verifiability, timeliness, understandability.
8. A coherent financial reporting should be transparent, comprehensive and consistent. barriers to creating a coherent financial reporting framework include valuation, standard setting and measurement.




# Session 7



## Reading 24: Understanding Income Statement



1. `revenues - expenses = net income = revenues - ordinary expenses + other income - other expenses + gains - losses`, investors use it for valuation purpose, while lenders use it to see whether or not the firm can make the promised profit and payments on its debts.
   1. revenue: the amounts reported from the sale of goods and services in the normal business;
   2. expense: the amounts incurred to generate revenue and include cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest and taxes, can be grouped by nature or function, group by function is sometimes referred to as the cost of sales method.
2. multi-step formats:
   1. revenue - cost of goods sold = ***Gross Profit***
   2. gross profit - operating expenses = ***Operating Profit***
   3. operating profit - interest expense = ***Income before Tax***
   4. income before tax -  provision for income tax - earnings from discountinued operations = ***Net Income***
3. expenses can be grouped by ***nature*** or ***function***: 生产和管理中的折旧费按性质分类；关于生产的一切成本（原料，折旧，人工）按功能分类；
4. special revenue recoginition: sometimes revenue may be recognized before delivery occurs or even after delivery taks places:
   1. long-term contacts: if the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated, use the ***percentage of completion method***, otherwise, under IFRS, use ***to the extent of contract costs*** method and ***completed contract method*** under GAAP. If a loss is expected, it must be recognized immediately under IFRS and GAAP.
   2. Installment sales: under GAAP, if collectibility is certain, revenue is recognized right now; if can not be reasonable estimated, using ***installment method***, if highly uncertain, using ***cost recovery method***.
   3. barter transaction: under GAAP, revenue from BT can be recognized at fair value if the firm has historically received cash payments for such goods and can use historical experience to determine fair value, otherwise use the carrying value of the asset surrendered; under IFRS, revenue must be based on fair value from similar non-barter transactions with unrelated parties. 
5. firms disclose their revenue recognition policies in the financial statement footnotes.
6. Inventory expenses recognition: if a firm can identify exactly which items were sold and which items remain in inventory, it can use the ***specific identification method***.
   1. FIFO: the cost of inventory acquired first is used to calculate the cost of goods sold, the cost of most recent purchases is used to calculate ending inventory. is appropriate for inventory that has a limited shelf life.
   2. LIFO: appropriate for goods that does not deteriorate with age.
   3. WAC: weighted average cost
   4. FIFO and WAC are both permitted under GAAP and IFRS, LIFO is allowed only under GAAP.
7. depreciation expense recognition:
   1. tangible assets: depreciation; natural resources: depletion; intangible assets: amortization
   2. straight line: SL depreciation expense = (cost - residual value ) / useful life
   3. accelerated depreciation method: speeds up recognition of depreciation in the early years, the ***declining balance method*** applies a constant rate of depreciation to an assets's book value each year, and the most common DB method is ***double-declining balance : DDB*** , which applies 2 times the straight line rate to the declining method: DDB depreciation = (2 / useful life) * (cost - accumulated depreciation)
8. amortization expense recognition:
9. bad debt and warranty expense recognition
10. Non-recurring items:
11. discontinued operations: measurement date, phaseout period;
12. unusual or infrequent items: the items are either unusual in nature ***or*** infrequent in occurrence.
13. extraordinary items: under GAAP, an extraordinary item was a material transaction or event that was ***both*** unusual and infrequent. for periods beginning after 12.5.2015, GAAP no longer allows items to be treated as extraordinary items, IFRS also does not allow items to be treated this way.
14. accounting changes: 
    1. accounting principles: a change in accounting principle requires retrospective application;
    2. accounting estimates: is the result of a change in management's judgment, is applied prospectively and does not require the restatement of prior financial statements;
    3. prior-period adjustments: a change from an incorrect accounting method to one that is accepted under GAAP or IFRS or the correction of an accounting error make in previous financial statements.
15. EPS: basic eps = (net income - preferred dividends) / weighted average number of common shares
16. Diluted EPS: too complex, skip it
17. gross profit margin = gross profit( revenue - cost of goods sold) / revenue
    1. net profit margin = net income / revenue
18. 股票期权和认证股权[options and warrants]只有当它们的执行价格低于全年股票的平均市场价格时，它们才可被视为可稀释每股收益的证券。使用***库藏股法***来就行计算：
    1. 假设通过执行期权公司所获得的资金用于以市场平均价格在市场上购买公司的普通股；
    2. 发行在外的普通股的净增加额等于执行期权所增加的普通股数量减掉执行后获得的收益所回购的股票数；



## Reading 25: Understanding Balance Sheet



1. use BS to assess a firm's liquidity and solvency, and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. liquidity is the ability to meet short-term obligations, solvency is the ability to meet long-term obligations.
2. current assets: cash and other assets that will likely be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle. it reveals information about the operating activities of the firm.
3. current liabilities: obligations will be satisfied within one year or one operating cycle.
4. working capital = current assets - current liabilities, less may indicate liquidity problem, more indicate inefficient use of assets.
5. noncurrent assets: opposite to current assets, it provide information about the firm's investing activities, which form the foundation upon the firm operates.
6. noncurrent liabilities: provides the firm's long-term financing activities.
7. 2 BS formats: ***classified BS*** and ***liquidity-based BS***.
8. current assets: 流动资产
   1. cash and cash equivalents: short-term, high liquid investments, are considered financial assets, are reported on the BS at amortized cost or fair value.
   2. marketable securities: financial assets that are traded in a public market.
   3. accounts receivable: are reported at net realizable value, which is based on estimated bad debt expense.
   4. inventories: goods held for sale to customers or used in manufacture of goods to be sold. manufactring firms separately report inventories of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods.
   5. other current assets: amounts that may not be material if shown separately, examples include prepaid expenses and deferred tax assets.
9. inventories: under IFRS, it's reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value; under GAAP, it's reported at the lower of cost or market.
10. current liabilities: 流动负债
11. accounts payable 应付账款: also trade payable, amounts the firm owes to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.
12. notes payable and current portion of long-term debt: 应付票据和当期该偿还的长期负债
13. accured liabilities: also accured expenses, 应记费用, are expenses that have been recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due. include taxes payable, interest payable, wages payable and accrued warranty expense.
14. unearned revenue: 未实现营收，预收收入，also known as unearned income, deferred revenue or deferred income, is cash collected in advance of providing goods and services.
15. Non-current assets: 非流动资产, property, plant and equipment ( PP&E ), under IFRS, PP&E can be reported using ***cost model*** or ***revaluation model***, under GAAP, only the ***cost model*** can be used.
    1. investment property
    2. intangible assets
    3. goodwill: the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business acquisition.
    4. financial assets: financial instruments are measured at historical cost, amortized cost or fair value.
    5. trading sercurities: also known as held-for-trading securities, are reported on BS at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the IS. Derivative instruments are treated the same as trading securities.
    6. available-for-sale securities: debt and equity that are not expected to be held to maturity or traded in the near term, it's reported on the BS at fair value, but any unrealized gains and losses are not recognized in the IS, are reported in other comprehensive income as a part of shareholders' equity.
16. ***Financial Assets***: hold-to-maturity securities, trading securities, available-for-sale securities;
17. long-term financial liabilities: include bank loans, notes payable, bonds payable and derivatives.
18. deferred tax liabilities: amounts of income taxes payable in future periods as a result of taxable temporary differences.
19. owers' equity: residual interest after subtracting an entity's liabilities. includes contributed capital, preferred stock, treasury stock, retained earnings, non-controlling interest, and accumulated other comprehensive income.
    1. contributed capital: 
    2. preferred stock: can be classified as debt or equity, perpetual preferred stock that is non-redeemable is equity, preferred stock that calls for mandatory redemption in fixed amounts is debt.
    3. noncontrolling interest: minority interest
    4. retained earnings: 
    5. treasury stock: reacquired by the issuing firm but not yet retired, it reduces stockholders' equity.
    6. accumulated other comprehensive income: aggregates net income and certain special transactions that are not reported in the income statement but that affect stockholders' equity.
20. liquidity ratios:
    1. current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
    2. quick ratio (acid test ratio) = ( cash + marketable securities + receivables ) / current liabilities
    3. cash ratio = ( cash + marketable securities ) / current liabilities
21. solvency ratios:
    1. long-term debt-to-equity = long-term debt / total equity
    2. total debt-to-equity = total debt / total equity
    3. debt ratio = total debt / total assets
    4. financial leverage = total assets / total equity 




## Reading 26. Understanding Cash Flow Statements

1. ***CFS*** provides information to assess the firm's liquidity, solvency and financial flexibility.
2. items on the css come from two sources: income statement itmes and changes in bs accounts.
3. A firm's cash receipts and payments can be classified as operating, investing and financing:
   1. ***CFO***: consists of inflows and outflows of cash resulting from transactions that affect a firm's net income.
   2. ***CFI***: consists of flows resulting from the acquisition or disposal of long-term assets and certain invests.
   3. ***CFF***: cosists of flows resulting from transactions affecting a firm's capital structure.
4. Noncash investing and financing activities are not reported in the cash flow statement since they do not result in inflows and outflows of cash. and non cash transactions mush be disclosed in either a footnote or supplement schedule.
5. different items classification of cash flows under GAAP and IFRS:
6. direct and indirect method of presenting CFS: both are permitted under GAAP and IFRS, direct method is encourged. the difference between the two methods relates to the presentation of CFO.
   1. direct method: 把权责制转换成收付实现制， converts an accrual-based income statement into a cash based income statement. the direct method begins with cash inflows from customers and them deduces cash outflows for purchases, operating expenses, interest and taxes. the starting point is the top of the income statement, revenues. it presents the firm's operating cash receipts and payments, which is useful in estimating future operating cash flows.
   2. indrect method: 将净利润转化成经营性现金流, net income is converted to operating cash flow by making adjustments for transactions that affect net income but are not cash transactions. the starting point is net income, the bottom line of the income statement. it focus on the differences in net income and operating cash flow, it provides a useful link to the income statement when forecasting future operating cash flow.
7. linking between cash flow and balance sheet:
   1. cfo + cfg + cfg = changing in cash balance; 
   2. changing in cash balance + beginning cash balance = ending cash balance
   3. beginning accounts receivalbe + sales - cash collection = ending accounts receivable
8. CFO is calculated differently, but the result is the same nder both methods, the calculation of cfi and cff is identical under both methods.
9. Steps in calculating CFO, CFI, CFF in direct method:
   1. CFO
      1. cash collected from customers
      2. cash used in the production of goods and services
      3. cash operating expenses
      4. cash paid for interest
      5. cash paid for taxes
   2. CFI: change in the gross asset accounts that result from investing activities. 
   3. CFF: 
      1. net cash flows from creditors = new borrowings - principal amounts repaid
      2. net cash flows from shareholders = new equity issued - share repurchases - cash dividends paid
10. Steps in calculating CFO, CFI, CFF in indirect method ( example on page 114):
11. CFO
     1. begin with net income
     2. subtract gains or add losses that resulted from financing or investing cash flows (such as gains from sale of land)
     3. add back all noncash charges to income (such as depreciation and amortization ), and subtract all noncash components of revenue.
     4. add or subtract changes to balance sheet operating accounts as follows:
        1. increases in the operating asset accounts (uses of cash) are subtracted, while decreases (sources of cash) are added;
        2. increases in the operating liability accounts (sources of cash) are added, while decreases (uses of cash) are subtracted.
12. ***Free cash flow*** is a measure of cash that is available for discretionary purposes.
     1. ***FCFF***: free cash flow to the firm is the cash available to all investors, both equity owners and debt holders. is calculated from net income as : 
        1. FCFF = NI + NCC + ***[Int x (1 - tax rate)]*** - FCInv - WCInv
        2. FCFF = CFO + [Int x (1 - tax rate)] - FCInv
     2. ***FCFE***: Free cash flow to equity is the cash flow that would be available for distribution to common shareholders, ca be calculated as follows:
        1. FCFE = CFO - FCInv + net borrowing
13. cash flow ratios can be categorized as performance ratios and coverage ratios:
     1. [PR] cash flow to revenue ratio measures the amount of CFO for each dollar of revenue: ***现金收入比：cash flow to revenue = CFO / net revenue***
     2. [PR] cash return-on-assets measures the return of CFO attributed to all providers of capital: ***现在资产比：cash return-on-assets = CFO / average total assets***
     3. [PR] cash return-on-equity ratio measures the return of CFO attributed to shareholders: ***现金权益比：cash return-on-equity = CFO / average total equity***
     4. [PR] cash to income ratio measures the ability to generate cash from firm operations: ***现金收益比：cash to income = CFO / operating income***
     5. [PR] cash flow per share is a variation of basic earnings per share measured by using CFO instead of net income: ***每股现金流：cash flow per share = (CFO - preferred dividends ) / (weighted average number of common shares)***
     6. [CR] debt coverage ratio measures financial risk and leverage: ***负债保障系数：debt coverage = CFO / total debts***
     7. [CR] interest coverage ratio measures the firm's ability to meet its interest obligations: ***利息保障倍数：interest coverage = (CFO + interest paid + taxes paid) / interest paid***
     8. [CR] reinvestment ratio measures the firm's ability to acquire long-term assets with operating cash flow: ***再投资比率： reinvestment = CFO / cash paid to long-term assets***
     9. [CR] debt payment ratio measures the firm's ability to satisfy long-term debt with operating cash flow: ***负债偿还倍数：debt payment = CFO / cash long-term debt repayment***
     10. [CR] dividend payment ratio measures the firm's ability to make dividend payments from operating cash flow: ***股利支付倍数：dividend payment = CFO / dividends paid***
     11. [CR] investing and financing ratio measures the firm's ability to purchase assets, satisfy debts and pay dividends: ***投融资比率：investing and financing = CFO / cash outflows from investing and financing activities***




## Reading 27. Financial Analysis Techniques



1. Ratio analysis, common-size analysis, graphical analysis and regression analysis, and differences of them. 

2. Financial ratios can be segregated into: 
   1. activity ratios: measure how efficiently the firm is managing its assets
      1. receivables = annual sales / average receivables
      2. days of sales outstanding = 365 / receivables
      3. inventory turnover = cost of goods sold / average inventory
      4. days of inventory on hand = 365 / inventory turnover
      5. payables turnover = purchases / average trade payables
      6. number of days of payables = 365 / payables turnover
      7. total asset turnover = revenue / average total assets
      8. fixed asset turnover = revenue / average net fixed assets
      9. working capital turnover = revenue / average working capital
   2. liquidity ratios: measure the ability the firm to pay its [ short ] debts
      1. current ratio: current assets / current liabilities, working capital = current assets - current liabilities
      2. quick ratio = ( cash + marketable securities + receivables ) / current liabilities
      3. cash ratio = ( cash + marketable securities ) / current liabilities
      4. defensive interval = ( cash + marketable securities + receivables ) /  average daily expenditures
      5. cash conversion cycle = days sales outstanding + days of inventory on hand - number of days of payables
   3. solvency ratios: measure its financial leverage and ability to pay long-term debt
      1. debt to equity = total debt / total shareholders' equity
      2. debt to capital = total debt / ( total debt + total shareholders' equity )
      3. debt to assets = total debt / total assets
      4. financial leverage = average total assets / average total equity
      5. interest coverage = earnings before interest and taxes / interest payments
      6. fixed charge coverage = ( earnings before interst and taxes + lease payments ) / ( interest payments + lease payments )
   4. profitability ratios: 
      1. net profit margin = net income / revenue
      2. gross profits = net sales - COGS; 
      3. operating profits = earnings before interest and taxes = EBIT = gross profit - operating expenses
      4. EBT = earning before taxes = operating profits - interest = EBIT - interest
      5. net income = earnings after taxes but before dividends
      6. total capital = long-term debt + short-term debt + common and preferred equity
      7. total capital = total assets
      8. gross profit margin = gross profit / revenue
      9. operating profit margin = operating income / revenue or EBIT / revenue
      10. ROA = ( net income + interest expense * (1 - tax rate) ) / average total assets
      11. ROE = net income / average total equity
   5. valuation ratios: 

3. ***DuPont Analysis***: 

   1. ROE = net income / average equity 

   2. ROE = net income / revenue * revenue / average equity

   3. ROE = net income / revenue * revenue / average total assets * average total assets / equity

      ​         = net profit margin * assets turnover * leverage ratio

   4. ROE(5) = net income / EBT * EBT / EBIT * EBIT / revenue * revenue / average assets * average assets / average  equity = tax burden * interest burden * EBIT margin * asset turnover * financial leverage

4. Per share measures are not comparable because the number of outstanding shares differ among firms.

5. the proportion of a firm's net income that is retained to fund growth is an important determinant of the firm's ***sustainable growth rate***, to estimate this, the rate of return on resources is measured as the return on equity capital, or the ROE, the proportion of earnings reinvested is known as the ***retention rate***, the formula for the sustainable growth rate is how fast the firm can grow without additional external equity issues while holding leverage constant, is *** g = RR x ROE ***. and the calculation of RR is : RR = ( net income available to common - dividends declared ) / net income available to common = 1 - dividend payout ratiod.

## Reading 28. Inventories



1. merchandising firms report inventory in one account on the balance sheet, manufacturing firms normally report inventory using three separate accounts: raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods.
2. ***COGS = beginning inventory + purchases - ending inventory***
3. product costs are capitalized in the inventories account:
   1. purchase cost less trade discounts and rebates
   2. conversion costs including labor and overhead
   3. ***other costs necessary to bring the inventory to its presetn location and condition***
4. period costs are expensed as incurred:
   1. abnormal waste of materials, labor, or overhead
   2. storage costs (***unless required as part of production***)
   3. administrative overhead
   4. selling costs
5. The cost of purchasing or producing inventory will change over time, so firms must select a cost flow method, or ***cost flow assumption*** under GAAP and ***cost flow formula*** under IFRS to allocate the inventory cost to the income statement and the balance sheet.
6. under IFRS, 3 method: Specific identification; FIFO, Weighted average cost
7. under GAAP, 4 method: Specific identification, FIFO, Weighted average cost, ***LIFO***
8. two kinds of inventory system: ***Periodic*** and ***Perpetual***, for FIFO and specific identification methods, ending inventory values and COGS are the same on both Periodic and Perpetual; however, periodic and perpetual system can produce different values for inventory and COGS under the LIFO and weighted average cost methods.
9. calculate and explain how inflation and deflation of inventory costs affect the financial statements.
10. firms that under LIFO mush report a ***LIFO reserve***, the amount by which LIFO inventory is less than FIFO inventory, to make financial statements prepared under FIFO comparable, we should:
 1. ***add the LIFO reserve to LIFO inventory on the BS***
 2. ***increase the retained earnings component of shareholder's equity by the LIFO reserve***
11. ***FIFO COGS = LIFO COGS - (ending LIFO reserve - beginning LIFO reserve)***
12. under IFRS, inventory is reported on the bs at the lower cost or net realizable value, net realizable value is equal to the expected sales price less the estimated selling costs and completion costs. inventory cannot be written up by more than it was previously written down [ exercise at page 191 ]
13. under GAAP, inventory is reported on the bs at the lower of cost or market. market is usually equal to replacement cost, but cannot be greater than NRV or less than NRV minus a normal profit margin. if there is a subsequent recovery in value, no write-up is allowed under GAAP.
14. ***Point: impactions of valuing inventory at net realizable value on financial statements and ratios***
15. inventory disclosures usually found in the financial statement footnotes, are useful in evaluating the firm's inventory management.
16. in certain industries, reporting inventory above historical cost is permitted under IRFS and GAAP, it applies to producers and dealers of commodity-like products, such as ***agricultural and forest products, mineral ores, and precious metals.***

## Reading 29. Long-Lived Assets

1. expenditure can be recorded as ***capitalize*** on the BS or as ***expense*** on the IS. for a general rule, an expenditure that is expected to provide a future economic benefit over multiple accounting periods is ***capitalized***, however if the future economic benefit is unlikely or highly uncertain, the expenditure is ***expensed*** in the period incurred.
2. intangible assets: finite-lived intangible asset is amortized over its useful life; indefinite-lived intangible asset are tested for impairment at least annually. under IFRS, ***identifiable intangible assets*** can be ***separated, controlled, benefits-provided***, unidentifiable intangible assets cannot be purchased separately and may have an indefinite life. bellowing intangible assets will be recorded in BS: created internnaly, purchased externally, obtained as part of a business combination:
   1. created internally: under IFRS, research costs are expensed as incurred, development costs may be capitalized; under GAAP, both research and development costs are generally expensed as incurred.
   2. purchased intangible assets: an intangible asset purchased from another party is recorded by its fair value at acquisition.
   3. obtained in a business combination: ***goodwill***
3. choice between capitalizing costs and expensing them will affect net income, equity, total assets, CFO, CFI and other financial ratios:
   1. net income: capitalizing an expenditure delays the recognition of an expense in the income statement, over the life of an asset, total net income is identical whether the asset's cost is capitalized or expensed. timing of the expense recognition in the income statement is the only difference.
   2. owners' equity: because capitalization results in higher net income, it is also results in higher shareholders' equity because retained earnings are greater.
   3. CFO, CFI: record as expense -> CFO outflow; capitalization -> CFI;
   4. financial ratios: capitalizing an expenditure initially results in higher assets and higher equity.
4. depreciation is the systematic allocation of an asset's cost over time, ***carrying (book) value*** is the net value of an asset or liability on the bs. ***historical cost*** is the original purchase price of the asset.
5. depreciation method:
   1. straight line: (original cost - salvage value) / depreciable life
   2. double decline method: ( 2 / depreciable life ) * book value at beginning of year X
   3. units-of-production method: ( original cost - salvage value ) / life in output units * output units in the period
6. IFRS requires firms to depreciate the components of an asset separately, and component depreciation is allowed under GAAP but seldom used. exercise page 217.
7. IFRS: as asset is impaired when its carrying value exceeds the ***recoverable value***, the recoverable value is the greater one of its fair value less any selling costs and its ***value in use***, the value in use is the present value of its future cash flow stream from continued use.
8. GAAP: an asset is considered impaired if the carrying value is greater than the asset's future ***undiscounted*** cash flow. if impaired, the asset's value is written down to fair value.
9. intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, they are tested for impairment at least annually, an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying value exceeds fair value.
10. eventually long-lived assets are removed from the bs, ***decognition*** occurs when assets are sold, exchanged or abandoned.
11. Impairment reduces an asset's carrying value on the BS, then affects other financial ratios, but has no impact on cash flow because it is an unrealized loss until the asset is disposed of.
12. derecognition of assets: under cost model, the carrying value of a long-lived asset is its historical cost minus accumulated depreciation or amortization, adjusted for any impairment charges taken. under the revaluation model, the carrying model of an asset is its value as of the last revaluation date, less any subsequent depreciation or amortization.
13. The ***average life*** of assets is useful for two reasons:
    1. older, less-efficient assets may make a firm less competitive;
    2. helps analysts to estimate the timing of major capital expenditures and a firm's future financing requirements.
14. calculation of average life: accumulated depreciation / annual depreciation expense
15. total useful life = historical cost / annual depreciation expense
16. remaining useful life = ending net PP&E / annual depreciation expense
17. under IFRS, property that a firm owns for the purpose of collecting rental income, earning capital appreciation or both, is classified as ***investment property***, GAAP does not distinguish this.
18. A ***fiance lease*** is a purchase of an asset that is financed with debt, over the term of the lease, the lessee will recognize depreciation expense on the asset and interest expense on the liability. An ***operating lease*** is essentially a rental arrangement, no asset or liability is reported by the lessee and the periodic lease payments are simply recognized as rental expense in the IS.



## Reading 30. Income Taxes

1. tax return terminology: taxable income -> taxes payable; income tax paid; tax loss carry forward; tax base;
2. financial reporting terminology: accounting profit; income tax expense; deferred tax liabilities; deferred tax assets; valuation allowance; carrying value; permanent difference; temporary difference;
3. A ***DTL: deferred tax liability: 财报上的应缴税所得 大于 纳税申报单上的*** is created when income tax expense is greater than taxes payable due to ***temporary differences***. the most common reason is that different depreciation methods are used on the tax return and the income statement. it will result in future cash outflows.
4. A ***DTA: deferred tax asset：财报上的应缴税所得 小于 纳税申报单上的*** is created when taxes payable(tax return) are greater than income tax expense(income statement) due to temporary differences. it can provide future tax savings, and typical causes of deferred tax assets are post-employment benefits, warranty expense and tax loss carryforwards.
5. tax base of assets: depreciable equipment;  research and development; accounts receivable
6. tax base of liabilities: customer advance; warranty liabilities; note payable;
7. when the income tax rate changes, DTA and DTL will be changed too, ***income tax expense = taxes payable + $\triangle DTL - \triangle DTA$***.
8. Permanent difference do not create DTA or DTL, but it will cause the firm's ***effective tax rate*** differ from the ***statutory tax rate***.
9. if temporary difference is expected to reverse , a DTA or DTL is created. taxable temporary differences will result in expected future taxable income and deductible temporary differences will result in expected future tax deductions.



## Reading 31. Non-Current ( Long-Term ) Liabilities

1. bond terminology: face value (maturity value, par value), coupon rate, coupon payments, effective rate of interest, balance sheet liability, interest expense;
2. bond type: par bond, discount bond, premium bond;
3. ***zero coupon bonds*** make no periodic interest payments, also known as a pure-discount bond.
4. Under GAAP, issuance costs are capitalized as an asset and allocated to the IS as an expense over the term of the bond. Under IFRS, the iitial bond liability on the BS is reduced by the amount of issuance costs, just treated as ***an unamortized discount***. under GAAP and IFRS, issuance costs are reported on the cash flow as a financing cash flow.
5. the book value of a bond liability is based on its market yield at issuance, an increase in the bond's yield will result in a decrease in the fair value of the bond liability. vice-verse, and for analysis, the market value of a firm's debt maybe more appropriate than its book value.
6. when bonds marture, no gain or loss is recognized by the issuer, when bonds are redeemed before maturity, a gain or loss is recognized by subtracting the redemption price from the book value of the bond liability at the reacquisition date.
7. ***debt covenants*** are restrictions imposed by the leader on the borrower to protect the lender's position, there are ***affirmative covenants*** and ***negative covenants***.
8. Firms reports all long-term debt on a single line on the BS, the portion that is due within the next year is reported as a current liability, and separartely discloses more detal about its long-term debt in the ***footnotes***, and a discussion of the firm's long-term debt is also found in the ***MD&A***.
9. why leasing assets instead of purchasing them: less costly financing; reduced risk of obsolescence; less restrictive provisions; off-balance-sheet financing; tax reporting advantages;
10. under IFRS, the classification of a lease is determined by the ***conomic substance*** of the transaction, if substantially all the rights and risks of ownership are transferred to the lessee, the lease is treated as ***finance lease***.
11. financial statement and ratio effects of operating and finance leases [by the ***lessee***]:
    1. BS: A finance lease results in a reported asset and liability. and operating lease are sometimes referred to as ***off-balance-sheet financing activities***.
    2. IS: operating income (EBIT) will be higher for companies that use finance leases relative to companies that use operating leases. but net income will be lower for a finance lease in its early years and higher in its later years, compared to an operating leases.
    3. CF: total cash flow is unaffected by the accounting treatment of a lease. if the lease is treated as an operating lease, then the total cash payment reduces cash from operations. if it's treated as a finance lease, then the interest expense reduces cash flow from operations, and the repayment of principal reduces cash flow from financing activities.
12. financial statement and ratio effects of operating and finance leases [by the ***lessor***]
    1. from the lessor's perspective, a capital lease under GAAP is treated as either a ***sales-type*** lease or a ***direct financing*** lease. IFRS does not distinguish those.
    2. a ***sales type lease*** is treated as if the lessor sold the asset for the present value of the lease payments and provided a load to the buyer in the same amount. at the inception of the lease, the lessor recognize a sale equal to the present value of the lease payments, and COGS equal to the carrying value of the asset.
    3. in a ***direct financing lease***, no gross profit is recogized by the lessor at the inception of the lease.
    4. if the lease is operating lease, the lessor simply recognizes the lease payment as rental income, and will keep the leased asset on its balance sheet and depreciate it over its useful life.
13. A ***pension*** is a form of deferred compensation earned over time through employee service. a ***defined contribution plan*** is a retirement plan in which the firm contributes a sum each period the the employee's retirement account. and a ***defined benefit plan*** will promise to make periodic payments to employees after retirement. for a defined benefit plan, the ***net pension asset*** or the ***net pension liability*** is a key element for analysis. if the fair value of the plan's assets is greater than the estimated pension obligation, the plan is said to be ***overfunded***, otherwise.
14. leverage ratios:
    1. debt-to-asset  = total debt / total assets
    2. debt-to-capital = total debt / (total debt + total equity), total capital and total assets differ by the firm's non-interest bearing liabilities.
    3. debt-to-equity = total debt / total equity
    4. financial leverage = average total assets / average total equity
15. coverage ratios:
    1. interest coverage = EBIT / interest payments
    2. fixed charge coverage = (EBIT + lease payments) / (interest payments + lease payments)

## Reading 32. Financial Reporting Quality

1. ***financial reporting quality*** refers to the characteristics of a firm's financial statements. high quality reporting must be ***decision useful***, two characteristics of decision-useful financial reporting are ***relevance*** and ***faithful representation***. relevant information must also be ***material***, and faithful encompasses the qualities of ***completeness*** and ***neutrality***.
2. the ***quality of earning*** is a separate issue, can be judged based on the ***substainability*** of the earnings.
3. ***aggressive accounting*** often results in decreased earnings in future periods, and ***conservative accounting*** will tend to increase future period earnings.
4. we should avoid thinking about conservatism in financial reporting as good and aggressive reporting as bad.
5. three factors that exist where management provides low-quality reporting are : motivation, opportunity and rationalization.
6. accounting methods that could be used to manage earnings, cash flow and balance sheet items:
   1. revenue recognition
   2. estimates of credit losses
   3. valuation allowance
   4. depreciation methods and estimates
   5. amortization and impairment
   6. inventory method
   7. related-party transactions
   8. capitalization
   9. other cash flow effects

1. types of items used to credit rating are : scale and diversification; operational efficiency; margin stability; leverge;
2. adjustments to improve the comparability of firm's financial statements and ratios:
   1. investments in securities: the classification of a firm's investment securities affects how changes in their values are recorded, which can affect reported earnings and assets.
   2. inventory accounting differences:
   3. differences in depreciation methods and estimates
   4. off-balance-sheet financing
